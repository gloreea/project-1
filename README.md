POST-PROJECT REFLECTION
Not able to get to most of my stretch goals, still getting comfortable with DOM manipulation. Had some moments where I had to do research to figure out how my code should be and it took me a bit to fully understand. I definetely see growth from where I was at three weeks ago, I would have no idea what to do, but I'm learning and improving.
